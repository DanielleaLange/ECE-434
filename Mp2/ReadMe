There is a room with 3 Wi-Fi access points (their locations are known). 
You are given the RSSI measurements from all 3 access points (APs) at N unique locations in the room, 
as well as the phone’s orientation when the measurement was taken.
Let’s call this the “offline phase”, and call the collected data "fingerprints". 
In the “online phase”, a user in the room walks along a straight line. 
Given the RSSI measurements collected by this user’s smartphone and the Wi-Fi fingerprints collected during the off-line phase,
your task is to find the beginning and end locations of this user’s 
walk.offline.csv contains data for the off-line phase and has 5 columns: 
(x, y, alpha, SSID, RSSI). 
1-walk-*.csv contain data collected during the on-line phase and has 3 columns:
(SSID, Time, RSSI)
ap_locations_1.csv contains the coordinates of each AP. This data is only needed if you want to implement optional optimizations.
