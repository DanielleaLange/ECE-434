There are eight voice assistants around the user. We will provide you with the location of these eight devices L0​,L1​,…,L7​, 
their microphone array configuration, and the recordings from each of these devices D0​,D1​,…,D7​. 
Your algorithm should take D0​,D1​,…D7​ and L0​,L1​,…L7​ as input and output the location of the user Lx​.
You can tackle this problem by doing AoA on all eight devices and then use triangulation to find the user location.
