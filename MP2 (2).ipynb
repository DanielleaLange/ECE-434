    "There is a room with 3 Wi-Fi access points (their locations are known). You are given the RSSI measurements from all 3 access points (APs) at $N$ unique locations in the room, as well as the phone’s orientation when the measurement was taken. Let’s call this the **“offline phase”**, and call the collected data **\"fingerprints\"**. In the **“online phase”**, a user in the room walks along a **straight** line. Given the RSSI measurements collected by this user’s smartphone and the Wi-Fi fingerprints collected during the off-line phase, **your task is to find the beginning and end locations of this user’s walk**.\n",
