    "Many off-the-shelf smart watches today are capable of taking the user's electrocardiogram (also called an ECG or EKG), a test that records the timing and strength of the electrical signals that make the heart beat. However, wearing the watch too loose, having sweat or dirt between the watch and wrist can all result in poor readings. In this MP, we will simulate this scenario. You will be given a ground truth reading $X$, and a watch reading $Y$. The watch reading will have 1 missing time window and added noise compared to the ground truth reading. In other words, $Y = X\\setminus W + N$, where $W$ is the missing time window and $N$ is random noise. Your task is to identify the start of the missing time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let $X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ and $Y = [0.9, 2.1, 5.2]$. We can see that the values $3$ and $4$ in $X$ are missing from $Y$. Your program should then return $2$, which is the index of the first missing value in $X$, aka the index of $3$ in $X$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are only simulating an ECG missing data scenario. The data used is not actually ECG data. However, this should not make a difference in your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"><b>Hint 1:</b> The DTW algorithm essentially constructs a cost matrix, $C$, between the two signals, based on the distance between points in the two signals. For every cell in this matrix, its value can be calculated as such: $C(c_j, r_j) = distance(c_j,r_j) + min\\{C(c_{j-1}, r_{j-1}), C(c_{j-1, r_{j}}), C(c_{j}, r_{j-1})\\}$. Refer to the lecture notes for more details.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"><b>Hint 2:</b> The missing time window can be identified by examining the cost matrix: 1 time point in $Y$ will match to multiple time points in $X$. You can approach this by starting at (0, 0) of the cost matrix and traveling towards (len(X), len(Y)). At every step, make a decision to go right, down or diagonal by choosing the cell with minimal cost. If for multiple steps in a row, the decision is to go down, then you might have encountered the missing time window since 1 point in $Y$ is being matched to multiple points in $X$</div>"
